including two larger vision-language models and two smaller text-only models as well as developer tools for building agentic applications based on the new models. Weights and code are free to developers who have less than 700 million monthly active users.

The upgraded 8B and 70B models perform better than their predecessors, while the 405B version rivals top proprietary models and enables researchers to generate high-quality synthetic data for training further models. The team provides extensive detail about how they generated fine-tuning data. For each task, they describe the pipeline used to create the data along with various notes about what worked and what didn’t work for them — helpful information for researchers who aim to build next-generation LLMs. [/INST] The Llama 3.2 family of models introduced by Meta includes two larger vision-language models and two smaller text-only models, as well as developer tools for building agentic applications based on the new models.
